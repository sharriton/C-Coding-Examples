BMI_CONVERSION
______________

The BMI_Conversion console app was made to import a BMI royalty statement.  There is data missing from the statement that needs
to be retrieved from the BPB.csv file. The BMI statement adjusts the title of the songs that are searched for. Because of that,
all of the titles from the BPB.csv file are imported and then converted to the naming conventions of the BMI royalty statement.
For example, all titles are capitalized, all titles that begin with 'The ' or 'A ' have 'The ' and 'A ' removed from the 
beginning etc.. There are multiple matches of some of the titles in the BPB.csv. The program creates a new folder on the desktop
with the days date that includes a .txt file that lists all track titles from the BMI royalty statement that have multiple 
matches in the BPB.csv file. This way someone can check by hand, if things were matched properly on those titles. Once all the 
title converting, importing and matching is done, a new BMI royalty statement is created in a folder on the desktop. The new 
statement includes all publisher data so that the correct publishers can be paid.
